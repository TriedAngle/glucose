<p align="center">
  <strong> multipurpose math and physics crate </strong> for the rust programming language with planned python bindings.
  implemented with the help of rust's new const generics
</p>

-----


#### Notes: 
* Rust 1.51 and onwards is required

* For planned and current features see TODO.md

* Why didn't you use crate X instead of writing Y yourself?  
  Because I decided not to ;)

* this project is under heavy development and not really usable from a consumer-perspective 
  right now. Expect many breaking updates as architecture and features are not decided yet.
