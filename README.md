  <strong> Note: </strong> 
  <ul>
      <li>
          Rust 1.51 (nightly only right now) and onwards is required
      </li>
      <li>
          this project is under heavy development and not really usable from a consumer-perspective 
          right now. Expect many breaking updates as architecture and features are not decided yet.
